**StellarNexus** is the first autonomous system that tracks, analyzes, and predicts the rise of top-tier open-source projects. Unlike static snapshots, StellarNexus provides live intelligence on GitHub's most influential repositories.

## üöÄ Why StellarNexus?

Previous attempts to track GitHub stars failed because they were:
- ‚ùå Manual and static
- ‚ùå Provided no predictive insight
- ‚ùå Lacked automated intelligence

We solve this with:
- ‚úÖ **Fully autonomous** daily updates via GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ **Machine learning-powered** trend forecasting
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly detection** to identify organic vs artificial growth
- ‚úÖ **Live leaderboard** and visualizations updated daily
