# ðŸ¤– AI Agent Prompts

This directory contains specialized AI agent prompts designed for the StellarNexus project development workflow.

## Files

### `universal-template.md`
A comprehensive template for AI agents working on any aspect of the StellarNexus project. This template provides:

- **Project Context**: Full understanding of StellarNexus platform and architecture
- **Code Quality Standards**: Python, testing, documentation requirements  
- **Architecture Principles**: Scalability, performance, reliability guidelines
- **Development Workflow**: Step-by-step process for implementing changes
- **Reusable Structure**: Placeholder sections for task-specific customization

**Usage**: Copy this template and replace `[TASK_DESCRIPTION]` and `[TASK_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS]` with specific requirements for your use case.

### `phase-0.md`
Specialized prompt for Phase 0 development tasks - the foundation phase of StellarNexus. This prompt covers:

- **Infrastructure Setup**: Database, caching, containers, configuration
- **Core Framework**: FastAPI structure, data models, authentication  
- **Development Workflow**: Testing, CI/CD, code quality, documentation
- **GitHub Integration**: API client, data collection, basic analytics
- **Success Metrics**: Specific goals and quality requirements for Phase 0

**Usage**: Use this prompt when working on foundational features, initial setup, or basic functionality implementation.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Select Appropriate Prompt**: Choose the universal template for general tasks or phase-0 for foundation work
2. **Customize Content**: Replace placeholder sections with specific task requirements
3. **Provide Context**: Include relevant code snippets, issues, or requirements
4. **Set Success Criteria**: Define clear, measurable goals for the AI agent
5. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results and feedback

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requirements and constraints
- **Include Examples**: Show expected code patterns and output formats
- **Set Quality Gates**: Define testing, documentation, and performance requirements
- **Reference Existing Code**: Point to relevant files and patterns in the codebase
- **Define Success**: Create measurable criteria for task completion
